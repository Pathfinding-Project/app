Current Work Todo

ISSUES/BUGS

[ ] Drawing Instructions do not have access to things like parent or allEvents (this means that road traces will not work)

[ ] The complexity of computed properties is relatively small (currently no special strings besides 'context' can be used, as they will be interpreted as variables eg. undefined would be converted to context[undefined])

[ ] id and pId should be able to be Strings

[ ] think we sometimes skip drwaing the first event or something

QUESTION

[ ] Current playback system won't support unpersisted component.

[ ] Current playback system
- Currently it works by adding x steps every tick (where x is determined by playbackRate) (this way allows for faster drawing)
- Should we change it so its reversed, 1 step every x ticks (x is playbackRate) (this way allows for slower drawing)

OPEN

[ ] Draw the map

[ ] Playback component for animation support - render/renderer/generic/Playback.tsx
- layered system for tiles

[ ] Add eventlist.context to converter, computed props

[ ] Nodelist config the cacheSize & type to setting slice

[ ] Change useCanvas pass as a context
- PROBLEM: multiple context required for each of the stage, many to many dependency
required here, not sure it's better or not.

[ ] An Context system for intermediate language - parser
- something like a speciman context
- takes in the search trace
- provide intermediate language for the renderer

[ ] Window system for multiple views - side by side
- As a parent component relative to xxxStage
- Manage the window system
- Choose which Stage to use in each of the view

[ ] Finish off the primitives
- Rectangle, Circle, Polygon, Path

[ ] Provide a set of pre-defined components/views for user to choose from
- user could display the search trace without defining views and components

[ ] Convert more Search Traces into current format
 - [*] Grid Trace
 - [*] Road Network Trace
 - [*] Mesh Trace
 - [ ] Tree Trace
 - [*] 9 Tile Puzzle Trace
 - [ ] Multi Agent Path Finder
 - [*] Bidirectional (Grid/Road versions) Trace

[ ] Create merger of eventList information so that delta eventLists will work

FINISHED

[x] A function that create Renderer component according to views definiation
- pass down the view definition to the canvas

[x] Create a stage for the PIXI renderer - renderer
- takes in the intermediate language
- provide add/delete function for each child nodelist

[x] Nodelist and LazyNodelist
- generic for stages/renderers
- caching the nodes
- use the add/delete function to

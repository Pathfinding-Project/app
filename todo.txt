Current Work Todo

ISSUES/BUGS

[ ] The complexity of computed properties is relatively small (currently no special strings besides 'context' can be used, as they will be interpreted as variables eg. undefined would be converted to context[undefined])

[ ] id and pId should be able to be Strings

[ ] The currentEventContext will break for search traces requiring information from parents every time it hits one of the LazyNodeList thresholds, as the allEvents property is actually only the events that are draw by the Nodelist. This needs to be fixed, maybe by using a global context or something. If stored once in a global context this may also reduce the memory usage.


QUESTION

[ ] Current playback system
- Currently it works by adding x steps every tick (where x is determined by playbackRate) (this way allows for faster drawing)
- Should we change it so its reversed, 1 step every x ticks (x is playbackRate) (this way allows for slower drawing)

OPEN

[ ] Hover over

[ ] Playback component for animation support - render/renderer/generic/Playback.tsx
- layered system for tiles

[ ] Change useCanvas pass as a context
- PROBLEM: multiple context required for each of the stage, many to many dependency
required here, not sure it's better or not.

[x] An Context system for intermediate language - parser
- something like a speciman context
- takes in the search trace
- provide intermediate language for the renderer

[ ] Window system for multiple views - side by side
- As a parent component relative to xxxStage
- Manage the window system
- Choose which Stage to use in each of the view

[ ] Provide a set of pre-defined components/views for user to choose from
- user could display the search trace without defining views and components

[ ] Convert more Search Traces into current format
 - [*] Grid Trace
 - [*] Road Network Trace
 - [*] Mesh Trace
 - [ ] Tree Trace
 - [*] 9 Tile Puzzle Trace
 - [ ] Multi Agent Path Finder
 - [*] Bidirectional (Grid/Road versions) Trace

[ ] Improve the process in which the currentEventContexts are created (maybe memoizee them)

[ ] Fix issue where if the parent undefined (starting event or something) the application wont error (if they used something like parent.x)

[ ] Maybe make the text property in the search traces an Object with properties like displayText, Colour, position (relative to parent Object) etc. Also maybe add some more properties to existing primitives like a lineWidth to the path primitive. 

[ ] Create merger of eventList information so that delta eventLists will work

FINISHED

[x] A function that create Renderer component according to views definiation
- pass down the view definition to the canvas

[x] Create a stage for the PIXI renderer - renderer
- takes in the intermediate language
- provide add/delete function for each child nodelist

[x] Nodelist and LazyNodelist
- generic for stages/renderers
- caching the nodes
- use the add/delete function to 

[x] Draw the map

[x] Add eventlist.context to converter, computed props

[x] Nodelist config the cacheSize & type to setting slice

[x] Current playback system won't support unpersisted component.

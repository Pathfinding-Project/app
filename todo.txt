Current Work Todo

QUESTION

[ ] Current playback system won't support unpersisted component.

[ ] Current playback system
- Currently it works by adding x steps every tick (where x is determined by playbackRate) (this way allows for faster drawing)
- Should we change it so its reversed, 1 step every x ticks (x is playbackRate) (this way allows for slower drawing)

OPEN

[ ] Draw the map

[ ] Playback component for animation support - render/renderer/generic/Playback.tsx
- layered system for tiles

[ ] Add eventlist.context to converter, computed props

[ ] Nodelist config the cacheSize & type to setting slice

[ ] Change useCanvas pass as a context
- PROBLEM: multiple context required for each of the stage, many to many dependency
required here, not sure it's better or not.

[ ] An Context system for intermediate language - parser
- something like a speciman context
- takes in the search trace
- provide intermediate language for the renderer

[ ] Window system for multiple views - side by side
- As a parent component relative to xxxStage
- Manage the window system
- Choose which Stage to use in each of the view

[ ] Finish off the primitives
- Rectangle, Circle, Polygon, Path

[ ] Provide a set of pre-defined components/views for user to choose from
- user could display the search trace without defining views and components

[ ] Convert more Search Traces into current format
 - [*] Grid Trace
 - [*] Road Network Trace
 - [*] Mesh Trace
 - [ ] Tree Trace
 - [*] 9 Tile Puzzle Trace
 - [ ] Multi Agent Path Finder
 - [*] Bidirectional (Grid/Road versions) Trace

[ ] Create merger of eventList information so that delta eventLists will work

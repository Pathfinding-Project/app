Current Work Todo

[ ] Create a stage for the PIXI renderer - renderer
- takes in the intermediate language
- provide add/delete function for each child nodelist

[ ] Nodelist and LazyNodelist
- generic for stages/renderers
- caching the nodes
- use the add/delete function to 

[ ] An Context system for intermediate language - parser
- something like a speciman context
- takes in the search trace
- provide intermediate language for the renderer

[ ] Window system for multiple views - side by side
- As a parent component relative to xxxStage
- Manage the window system
- Choose which Stage to use in each of the view

[ ] Work on drawing text onto them in memory efficent ways

[ ] Performance optimize
- create algorithm reduce the graphics objects in lazynodelist

[ ] Convert more Search Traces into current format

[ ] Create merger of eventList information so that delta eventLists will work
